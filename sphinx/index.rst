StagToolkit - *master* branch
=============================

Here's the docs! This stuff is currently really experimental, so sorry it's a mess.

Currently, **gdextension docs cannot be automatically updated**
(see `#105079 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/105079>`_ and `gdextension documentation tutorial <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/gdextension_docs_system.html>`_).
Right now Godot just dumps empty XML files for you to fill out yourself.
I'd like to automate this, but haven't gotten to it.

If you're looking for the latest docs for StagToolkit's gdextension nodes, it's best to **check the internal docs within Godot Engine** using the "Search Help" menu.
